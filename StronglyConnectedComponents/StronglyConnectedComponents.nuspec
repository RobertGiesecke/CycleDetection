    <summary>
		This is a fork of Daniel Bradley's C# implementation of the Tarjan cycle detection algorithm.

		IOW: You can use this library to sort dependencies and even handle cyclic references. e.g. to compile stuff in the right order.

		I found it to be quite useful but I didn't like how one had to manually setup the dependency vertices. (It also supports custom comparers now.)

		So I moved the original code into the Core sub namespace and wrote a class that allows to setup dependencies using a simple lambda expression.
